# Diamond Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of a diamond using Machine Learning. We trained various regression models. And we evaluated their performance using the R Squared and RMES.

# Dataset
A favorable dataset to answer the research questions effectively is one that has at least two features that can be predicted. The dataset has a reasonable dimension i.e. (53940, 10). This means that it has information on 53940 round-cut diamonds. Each of the 53940 observations represents a different diamond. The dataset also has 10 features that describe each of those 53940 observations. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.
